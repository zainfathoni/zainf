## What is Vibe Coding?

![bg right:40%](assets/iron-man.png)

> "Fully give in to the vibes and essentially forget the code exists" — Simon
> Willison

- :zap: **Rapid AI code generation**
- :crystal_ball: Minimal code review
- :test_tube: "Just see what happens"
- :sparkles: Playful, experimental process
- :surfer: Accepting changes without reading diffs

---

## The Vibe Coding Philosophy

### :wave: Democratizing Development

**Positive aspects:**

- :unlock: Lowers barriers to software development
- :books: Helps learn through experimentation
- :bulb: Builds intuition about AI capabilities
- :hammer_and_wrench: Enables non-technical people to create tools

**But with caveats...**

---

## Three Developer Personas

### :busts_in_silhouette: Who are you?

1. :sparkles: **"Vibe Coders"** - Rely heavily on AI, minimal review
2. :cowboy_hat_face: **"Rodeo Cowboys"** - High-risk, fast-paced coding
3. :lock: **"Prisoners"** - Overly constrained, risk-averse

**Goal:** Balance between speed and discipline

---

## When Vibe Coding Works

### :white_check_mark: Low-Stakes Scenarios

- :art: **Weekend projects** - Personal experiments
- :bulb: **Rapid prototyping** - Quick proof of concepts
- :trophy: **Hackathons** - Speed over perfection
- :wrench: **One-off scripts** - Throwaway automation
- :compass: **Learning experiments** - Building coding intuition

**Key:** Low stakes, no production impact, learning-focused

---

## Safeguards for Vibe Coding

### :shield: Stay Safe When Vibing

Even in low-stakes projects, be cautious with:

- :key: **Secrets handling** - API keys, credentials
- :lock: **Private data** - Personal or sensitive information
- :globe_with_meridians: **Network requests** - Unexpected API calls
- :moneybag: **Financial implications** - Payment processing

---

## When Vibe Coding Fails

### :x: High-Stakes Disasters

- :lock: **Security vulnerabilities** - Exposed credentials, SQL injection
- :snail: **Performance issues** - Unoptimized queries, memory leaks
- :spaghetti: **Unmaintainable code** - No structure, inconsistent patterns
- :question: **Lack of understanding** - Can't debug or extend
- :bomb: **Production incidents** - Real-world consequences

---

## Real-World Disasters

### :see_no_evil: Learning from Failures

- :bomb: AI agent deletes company database
  - <https://www.pcmag.com/news/vibe-coding-fiasco-replite-ai-agent-goes-rogue-deletes-company-database>
- :fire: Production incidents from unverified AI code
  - <https://x.com/albertadevs/status/1947095566736904562>
  - <https://x.com/anothercohen/status/1948878534262575430>

---

## The Cost of Vibe Debugging

### :detective: "Like Archaeology"

**When vibe coding reaches production:**

- :chart_with_downwards_trend: **Performance issues** - Queries work in dev,
  crash in production
- :lock: **Security bugs** - Inverted logic, hidden vulnerabilities
- :spaghetti: **Maintainability nightmare** - "Middleware scattered across six
  files"
- :arrows_counterclockwise: **Cascading failures** - Minor changes break
  everything
- :wastebasket: **Complete rewrites** - Often the only solution

## :no_entry_sign: Not an excuse to Skip Engineering

## The Critical Distinction

### :x: **Vibe Coding ≠ AI-Assisted Engineering**

> "AI can accelerate development, but it cannot replace fundamental software
> engineering principles." — Addy Osmani

**Vibe coding:** Great for learning and exploration **Production software:**
Requires engineering discipline

---

## AI-Assisted Engineering

### :gear: Structured Approach for Production

- :shield: **Human oversight** - Review and verify all code
- :books: **Engineering principles** - Architecture, patterns, standards
- :test_tube: **Rigorous testing** - Unit, integration, E2E
- :mag: **Code review** - Same standards as human-written code
- :handshake: **AI as collaborative tool** - Not replacement

---

## Spec-Driven Development

### :memo: Best Practices for Production

1. :clipboard: **Start with clear specifications**
2. :handshake: **Collaborate with AI on design**
3. :test_tube: **Write tests first** (TDD)
4. :arrows_counterclockwise: **Iterate in testable increments**
5. :eyes: **Maintain human oversight**
6. :mag: **Review and understand** all generated code

---

## Treat AI Like a Junior Developer

### :teacher: Supervision Required

- :white_check_mark: Review all code thoroughly
- :test_tube: Implement rigorous testing
- :art: Maintain clear architectural intent
- :books: Ensure understanding, not just acceptance
- :busts_in_silhouette: Apply same standards as human developers

**AI needs guidance and verification**

## The Spectrum of AI-Assisted Development

| Aspect                  | Vibe Coding           | AI-Assisted Engineering |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| :dart: **Use Case**     | Learning, experiments | Production systems      |
| :shield: **Risk**       | Low stakes            | High stakes             |
| :mag: **Review**        | Minimal               | Rigorous                |
| :test_tube: **Testing** | Happy path only       | Comprehensive           |
