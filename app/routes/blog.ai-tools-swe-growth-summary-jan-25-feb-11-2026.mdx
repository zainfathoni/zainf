## Scope

- Date range: January 25 to February 11, 2026
- Source: WhatsApp group "AI Tools SWE GROWTH"

## Key topics discussed

### OpenClaw dominance

OpenClaw continues to be the primary topic of discussion. Members are actively using it for:

- Agent orchestration via Telegram, WhatsApp, and Discord
- Running coding agents on Mac Mini or VPS
- Automated nightly development workflows
- Multi-agent coordination (for example, Wheeljack for coding)

**Notable quote:** "Openclaw boros bgt asli" (OpenClaw uses a lot of tokens), highlighting token consumption concerns.

### Claude Code memory issues

Several members reported Claude Code CLI consuming excessive RAM:

- One user reported 90 GB memory consumption causing a MacBook freeze
- Discussion about memory leaks and auto-compaction
- Tip: Regular hard restarts help prevent issues
- Running multiple CLI sessions (5+) compounds the problem

### AmpCode free credits strategy

- Free tier offers $20 per day with ads
- Members shared strategies to maximize free credits
- AmpCode Threads feature helps share coding sessions publicly
- "Amp deep mode bagus bgt" received positive reviews
- Free tier currently closed for new users (as of Feb 11)

### Agent orchestration wars

New tools are emerging rapidly:

- NanoClaw, a lightweight version (reported as unreliable)
- TinyClaw, another lightweight alternative
- PicoClaw, even smaller (some calling it "hype-based development")
- Warp Oz, Warp's new agent orchestration feature
- AugmentCode teasing upcoming features

### Model comparisons and usage

| Model | Use case | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Opus 4.5/4.6 | Complex planning, ADR | Fast but expensive |
| Codex 5.3 | Major features, refactoring | More thorough than Opus |
| Kimi K2.5 | Daily coding | DHH testimonial, good price |
| GPT 5.2 | OpenClaw continuous ops | Free tier available |
| Gemini | UI and frontend design | "Melempem" (underperforming) |

## Tools and products mentioned

### Coding agents

- OpenClaw, the primary orchestration platform
- AmpCode, a CLI with free credits and thread sharing
- Claude Code CLI, the main coding agent
- Codex CLI, OpenAI's coding agent
- Kimi CLI, a Chinese AI for budget coding
- Gemini CLI, Google's offering (criticized as "anak tiri")
- Cursor CLI, VS Code-based coding
- GitHub Copilot CLI with the `/fleet` feature for parallel subagents

### Supporting tools

- supacode.sh, session management for multiple repos and worktrees
- Ghostty, a terminal emulator (memory leak issues in v1.2.3)
- opencode zen, Kimi integration with CPT guarantee
- Antigravity, an AI coding platform

### Hardware

- Mac Mini, popular for hosting OpenClaw
- Beelink Mini PC, an AMD 255 series alternative
- VPS, a cloud hosting option

## Notable tips and insights

### Vibe coding to vibe user testing

Using Claude Code Agents Team to spawn multiple user personas for UX testing:

```text
Main agent -> spawns 3 user personas -> tests app via Chrome -> provides UX research report
```

**Warning:** Token consumption is "luar biasa" (extraordinary).

### Nightly bot instructions

Prompt used to make a bot build features autonomously:

> I need an employee taking as much off my plate and being as proactive as possible. Every night when I go to bed, build something cool I can test. Schedule time to work every night at 11pm.

### AmpCode and tmux trick

Running AmpCode in tmux allows using free credits without watching ads:

- OpenClaw can spawn tmux sessions
- AmpCode interactive mode works in tmux
- Credits are not consumed (uses free tier)

### Token management

- Use different models for different tasks (Opus for planning, Codex for review)
- Split workload: "saya kasih akses cursor cli & gemini cli biar bagi tugas (token)"
- Consider a $200 per month Claude subscription for unlimited Opus

### Skills for the AI era

- Generalist versus specialist debate
- Sales and marketing skills are becoming important
- "Banyak orang belum tau AI kegunaannya apa"
