# AI Tools SWE Growth Summary

**Date Range:** January 25 - February 11, 2026
**Source:** WhatsApp Group "AI Tools SWE GROWTH"

---

## 🎯 Key Topics Discussed

### 1. OpenClaw Dominance
[OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) continues to be the primary topic of discussion. Members are actively using it for:
- Agent orchestration via Telegram/WhatsApp/Discord
- Running coding agents on Mac Mini or VPS
- Automated nightly development workflows
- Multi-agent coordination (e.g., Wheeljack for coding)

**Notable quote:** "Openclaw boros bgt asli" (OpenClaw uses a lot of tokens) - highlighting the token consumption concern.

### 2. Claude Code Memory Issues
Several members reported [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) consuming excessive RAM:
- One user reported 90GB memory consumption causing MacBook freeze
- Discussion about memory leaks and auto-compaction
- Tip: Regular hard restarts help prevent issues
- Running multiple CLI sessions (5+) compounds the problem

### 3. AmpCode Free Credits Strategy
- Free tier offers $20/day with ads
- Members sharing strategy to maximize free credits
- AmpCode Threads feature for sharing coding sessions publicly
- "Amp deep mode bagus bgt" - positive reviews of deep mode
- Free tier currently closed for new users (as of Feb 11)

### 4. Agent Orchestration Wars
New tools emerging rapidly:
- **NanoClaw** - lightweight version (reported as unreliable)
- **TinyClaw** - another lightweight alternative
- **PicoClaw** - even smaller (some calling it "hype-based development")
- **Warp Oz** - [Warp](https://www.warp.dev)'s new agent orchestration feature
- **AugmentCode** - teasing upcoming features

### 5. Model Comparisons & Usage

| Model | Use Case | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Opus 4.5/4.6 | Complex planning, ADR | Fast but expensive |
| Codex 5.3 | Major features, refactoring | More thorough than Opus |
| [Kimi K2.5](https://kimi.moonshot.cn) | Daily coding | DHH testimonial, good price |
| GPT 5.2 | OpenClaw continuous ops | Free tier available |
| Gemini | UI/Frontend design | "Melempem" (underperforming) |

## 💡 Notable Tips & Insights

### 1. Vibe Coding → Vibe User Testing
Using [Claude Code Agents Team](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams) feature to spawn multiple user personas for UX testing:
```
Main agent → spawns 3 user personas → tests app via Chrome → provides UX research report
```
**Warning:** Token consumption is "luar biasa" (extraordinary)

### 2. Nightly Bot Instructions
Prompt to make bot build features autonomously:
> "I need an employee taking as much off my plate and being as proactive as possible... Every night when I go to bed, build something cool out I can test. Schedule time to work every night at 11pm"

### 3. AmpCode + tmux Trick
Running AmpCode in tmux allows using free credits without watching ads:
- OpenClaw can spawn tmux sessions
- AmpCode interactive mode works in tmux
- Credits don't get consumed (uses free tier)

### 4. Token Management
- Use different models for different tasks (Opus for planning, Codex for review)
- Split workload: "saya kasih akses cursor cli & gemini cli biar bagi tugas (token)"
- Consider $200/month Claude subscription for unlimited Opus

### 5. Skills for AI Era
Discussion about adapting to AI tools:
- Generalist vs Specialist debate
- Sales/marketing skills becoming important
- "Banyak orang belum tau AI kegunaannya apa"
